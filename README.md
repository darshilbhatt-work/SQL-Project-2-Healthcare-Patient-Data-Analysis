# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Data Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills in analyzing patient data for insights into healthcare management.  
The dataset includes patients, doctors, visits, and treatments.  

The goal is to:
- Extract key insights about patient demographics
- Identify trends in treatments & visits
- Work with real-world SQL concepts like **joins, subqueries, grouping, filtering, and string functions**

This project highlights **business analysis + data-driven decision-making**, useful for roles like **Business Analyst, Marketing Analyst, and Data Analyst**.

## 🗂️ Database Schema
I have created 4 tables:

- **patients** → stores patient info (id, first name, last name, gender, birth date)
- **doctors** → stores doctor details
- **visits** → records patient visits to doctors
- **treatments** → treatment information linked to patients
